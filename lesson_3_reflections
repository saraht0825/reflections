When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you're working on a group project, or if someone else is working on your computer and you'll need 
to access your work from a different location, it's necessary to have a remote. Remotes are also 
useful if you want to keep your work public so that others can contribute to your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling from GitHub ensures that your most up-to-date project is accessible to anyone else using your
remote. This is imperative if you're working with other contributors.
