When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you're working on a group project, or if someone else is working on your computer and you'll need 
to access your work from a different location, it's necessary to have a remote. Remotes are also 
useful if you want to keep your work public so that others can contribute to your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling from GitHub ensures that your most up-to-date project is accessible to anyone else using your
remote. This is imperative if you're working with other contributors.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of 
another?

A branch is a part of your master project that relates to your original code so that you can 
confidently experiment with your project and/or code without worrying about breaking original content.
It is different from a clone of your repository in that a clone of your repository is usually ready
to be shared remotely. A fork is a clone of your remote but is made from GitHub to GitHub.
