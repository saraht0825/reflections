When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you're working on a group project, or if someone else is working on your computer and you'll need to access your work from a different
location, it's necessary to have a remote. Remotes are also useful if you want to keep your work public so that others can contribute to
your project.
