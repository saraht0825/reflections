What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you're creating space for git to store commits and code among
different file types so that you or others can access that code later remotely. You need to do it
in order to stage files and save them to your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that the staging area is a part of git
and the working directory is only founc locally on your own machine. The value it offers is that it 
allows a space for the user to decide which parts of the working directory should be uploaded to the
repository and in which commits they should be uploaded.
